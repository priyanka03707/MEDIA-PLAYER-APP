# DESCRIPTION
The Media Player App is an offline Android application designed to provide a smooth and intuitive audio playback experience for users. This app allows users to browse, select, and play music files stored on their device without requiring an internet connection. Built using Android Studio with Java, it leverages Android’s MediaPlayer API for seamless audio playback. The app offers essential music player features, including play, pause, skip, seek, volume control, and an organized list of audio files for easy navigation.

One of the app’s core functionalities is its user-friendly and visually appealing UI, featuring a dark theme with animated transitions for an immersive user experience. The RecyclerView dynamically fetches and displays available audio files from local storage, allowing users to browse their music collection effortlessly. A SeekBar is implemented to provide real-time tracking of the song’s progress, while a Volume Control slider enables users to adjust the audio output directly within the app.
